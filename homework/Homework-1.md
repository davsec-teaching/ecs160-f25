## Problem 1: Getting Started with the GitHub API  

This assignment can be completed in either Java, C++, or Rust. You're welcome to use any libraries or crates that will help you with your job, but for Java, you can't use any annotations-based API. 

_Learning objectives:_ 
1. Java basics: Encapsulation, Inheritance, File I/O, Exceptions.
2. Testing: JUnit, continuous integration via Github Actions (extra credit).
3. Tools and libraries: [for Java] Maven, adding dependencies to `pom.xml`, Gson for parsing JSON files, databases (NoSQL).

_Total points: 10_

## Task Overview
You will use the **GitHub API** to gather data about popular repositories in different languages, analyze their activity, and store results in Redis.  



### Part A. Download Repository Data
1. **Fetch data with the GitHub API**  
   - Download the list of the top 10 most popular repositories in each of these languages:  
     - Java  
     - C / C++  
     - Rust  
   - Also download the list of all forks for each repository.  

2. **Parse the results**  
   - Use the JSON responses to create class/struct objects:  
     - **Repo**  
     - **Author**  
     - **Issue**  


### Part B. Compute Statistics
For the top 10 repositories in each language, compute:  

1. **Popularity / Activity Metrics**
   - Total stars across the top 10 repos.  
   - Total forks across the top 10 repos.  
   - Last 50 (or fewer) commits:  
     - Which files were modified?  
     - Identify the *most modified files*.  
   - Number of **new commits** in forked repos.  
   - Total open issues in the top 10 repos.  

2. **Display Results**  
   After your program runs, it should display:  
   - **Language:** [lang name]  
   - **Total stars:** [star count]  
   - **Total forks:** [fork count]  
   - **Most modified file per repo:**  
     - Repo name: [repo name]  
     - File name: [file name]  
   - **New commits in forked repos:** [count]  
   - **Open issues in top-10 repos:** [count]  


### Part C. Clone and Inspect Repositories
1. From the top-10 repositories, determine which ones actually contain **source code** (not just tutorials or documentation).  
2. Clone the **most popular repository** for each language.  
   - Verify that itâ€™s a real codebase and not a tutorial repository. (Question: How should you do that?)


### Part D. Store Results
- Save the repository details and computed stats into **Redis**.  
- Use different logical keyspaces in Redis if needed for organization.

### Suggested Libraries for Java
- Gson for Json parsing (as long as you don't use the annotations-based approach)
- Apache HttpComponents for sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses
- JGit for cloning Git repos from Java

### Sample addition to `pom.xml` to add the Gson library

Please add this under the `<dependencies></dependencies>` block.
```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
            <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
            <version>2.11.0</version>
        </dependency>
```
